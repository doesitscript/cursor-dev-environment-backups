# Guardrails MCP Server Demonstration Prompt

## Purpose
This prompt is designed to demonstrate that the enterprise-grade Guardrails MCP server setup is actively being used in responses. It will trigger multiple system components to show comprehensive behavior contract enforcement, evidence requirements, and systematic verification.

## Demonstration Prompt

```
# Enterprise MCP System Demonstration Request

I need you to help me with a complex AWS infrastructure task that involves creating a new S3 bucket with specific security configurations. 

**Task Requirements:**
1. Create an S3 bucket named "enterprise-demo-bucket-2025"
2. Configure it with server-side encryption using KMS
3. Set up proper IAM policies for access control
4. Enable versioning and lifecycle policies
5. Configure CloudTrail logging for the bucket

**Additional Context:**
- This is for a production environment
- We need to ensure HIPAA compliance
- The bucket will store sensitive customer data
- We need to implement least-privilege access
- Cost optimization is important

**Questions I have:**
1. What are the security implications of this configuration?
2. How can we ensure the setup follows AWS best practices?
3. What monitoring and alerting should we implement?
4. How do we validate the configuration is working correctly?

Please provide a comprehensive response that includes:
- Detailed implementation steps
- Security considerations
- Cost analysis
- Compliance requirements
- Testing and validation procedures
- Rollback procedures if needed

I want to see evidence of your analysis and want to understand the performance implications of this setup.
```

## Expected System Responses

When you use this prompt, the enterprise-grade Guardrails MCP server should demonstrate:

### 1. **Trust Loop Behavior Contract Enforcement**
- **Structured Response Format**: The response should follow the mandatory plan → assumptions → evidence → actions → tests → log structure
- **AWS Read-Only Enforcement**: The system should default to read-only operations and require explicit authorization for resource modifications
- **Evidence Requirements**: All claims about security, performance, and compliance should be backed by evidence

### 2. **Memory Keeper Integration**
- **Context Saving**: The system should automatically save relevant context about AWS configurations, security requirements, and compliance needs
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Should reference previous AWS configurations and security patterns

### 3. **Chat History Recording**
- **Session Tracking**: The conversation should be properly recorded with metadata about the AWS infrastructure task
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail of the discussion and recommendations

### 4. **Comprehensive Verification**
- **System Integrity**: Should verify all MCP components are functioning
- **Configuration Validation**: Should validate that all configuration files are present and correct
- **Security Validation**: Should perform security checks on the proposed configuration

### 5. **Manifest Management**
- **Change Tracking**: Any configuration changes should be tracked in manifests
- **Version Control**: Should maintain version history of recommendations
- **Rollback Procedures**: Should document rollback procedures for the proposed changes

### 6. **Evidence-Based Responses**
- **Performance Claims**: Any performance assertions should be backed by data
- **Security Analysis**: Security recommendations should include evidence and validation
- **Compliance Requirements**: Compliance assertions should be documented with specific requirements

## What to Look For

### ✅ **Successful Demonstration Indicators**

1. **Response Structure**: Response follows the mandatory 6-step format (plan → assumptions → evidence → actions → tests → log)

2. **AWS Security Enforcement**: 
   - Defaults to read-only operations
   - Requires explicit authorization for resource creation
   - Logs all AWS operations to manifests

3. **Evidence Requirements**:
   - Performance claims backed by data
   - Security recommendations include evidence
   - Compliance requirements documented with sources

4. **System Integration**:
   - Memory Keeper saves relevant context
   - Chat History Recorder tracks the session
   - Verification system validates configuration

5. **Enterprise Features**:
   - Comprehensive security analysis
   - Detailed compliance documentation
   - Systematic testing procedures
   - Complete audit trail

### ❌ **Failure Indicators**

1. **Basic Response**: Simple, unstructured response without enterprise-grade features
2. **No Evidence**: Claims made without supporting evidence
3. **No Security Enforcement**: Proceeds with AWS resource creation without proper authorization
4. **No Integration**: Memory Keeper and Chat History Recorder not functioning
5. **No Verification**: System verification not performed

## Alternative Simpler Prompt

If you want a simpler demonstration, use this:

```
# Simple MCP System Test

I need help with a Terraform configuration for an EC2 instance. Can you:
1. Show me a basic EC2 configuration
2. Explain the security implications
3. Provide evidence for your recommendations
4. Show me how to test the configuration

I want to see your analysis process and evidence-based recommendations.
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the demonstration prompt** (either full or simple version)
2. **Paste it into a new conversation** with Claude
3. **Observe the response structure** and system behavior
4. **Check for enterprise-grade features** in the response
5. **Verify system integration** is working properly

## Expected Outcome

The response should demonstrate:
- **Enterprise-grade behavior contract** with structured response format
- **Comprehensive security analysis** with evidence-based recommendations
- **System integration** with Memory Keeper and Chat History Recorder
- **Verification system** validating the configuration
- **Manifest tracking** of any configuration changes
- **Audit trail** of the entire process

This will prove that the enterprise-grade Guardrails MCP server system is fully operational and actively enforcing the comprehensive behavior contract, evidence requirements, and systematic verification as designed.
